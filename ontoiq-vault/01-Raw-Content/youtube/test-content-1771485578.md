# Test Content

This is a test markdown file to verify the Content Ingestion workflow is working correctly after fixing the file access permissions.

## Key Points

- File access fix applied: N8N_BLOCK_FILE_ACCESS_TO_N8N_FILES=false
- Volume mount verified: /home/node/vault/raw/ accessible
- Scheduled run: Next at 6:00 PM

## Expected Behavior

This file should be ingested by the workflow and appear in the content_sources table.
